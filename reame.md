🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML5

CSS3

JavaScript (Vanilla)

Browser's localStorage for data persistence

🧠 How It Works
You fill in the form with the type (Credit/Debit), amount, category, month, and (optional) description.

The data is saved into localStorage.

Transactions are displayed in a dynamic table.

You can filter and view a summary at the bottom.

🔄 Reset or Clear Data?
Just open the browser’s developer tools, go to Application > Local Storage, and delete the expenses key. Or, you can add a Clear All button for convenience (feel free to ask if you need help doing that 😊).
